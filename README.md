# Sherpa - A Boilerplate WordPress Theme
A SCSS-flavored, Twitter Bootstrap-based boilerplate for developing WordPress themes.

## Current Version
3.7.2 - Annapurna

## Introduction
When I think of a Sherpa, I think of the locals that help visitors get to the top of Mount Everest.  They carry the gear up most of the way, helping the expedition out tremendously.

This is the concept of Sherpa.  It's a boilerplate theme that is built to help you get to the top faster.  Its origins are from the work of building many websites, realizing that the same pieces were being used over and over, and starting to collect the pieces into one boilerplate theme.

## Description
Sherpa is based on Twitter Bootstrap with some FontAwesome thrown in.  It's also set up to use Typekit and Google Fonts, though we can use other font services if requested.

Sherpa was originally intended to be used with [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/), an excellent compiler for SCSS as well as Javascript, among other things.  If you are not going to be using Codekit, you will need to adjust `inc/scripts.php` to reflect the fact that you are not using `/js/min/main-min.js`.

We are now including a gulp file but it's not perfect.  Please use at your own risk.  If you know how to make it better, please send a pull request!

**Sherpa is not meant to be an end-all; it is meant to be a start-all.**

## Coming Up
We are working on adding maps to Sherpa in a big way for our 4.0 release.  If you want to see how it's working then check out the `dev-map` branch.
