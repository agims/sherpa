# sherpa
A SCSS-flavored, Twitter Bootstrap-based boilerplate for developing WordPress themes.

## Introduction
Sherpa was born because I ended up reusing the same files over and over again to create a theme.  I am trying to update it each time I work on a new theme to include things I use over and over.

## Frameworks and Dependencies
* Twitter Bootstrap (SCSS) - v3.3.2
* FontAwesome - v4.3.0
